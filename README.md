<b> Phone Book </b>
<br>
The Web Application Phone Book lets you create and list contacts with their name and primary phone number. If the contact has more than one number you may add that in as well and search the directory to see all the possible numbers each contact has on a separate page.

<b>Setup:</b>
<br>
Install Bundler (with $gem install bundler) and run bundle to install the necessary gems. Then start the Sinatra server, and navigate https://localhost:4567/ to view the interactive application.
